This project from the university (realised only front-end part).
The project represents little course from 5 tasks. Tasks dedicated to building plots, pie charts and diagrams on d3.js. 
The theme of this course is exploration of the Titanic's tragedy.
For each task in the project I use "ace" editor and two iframes.
