    <p class="little-title first-title">Welcome to our course. As you can see it's dedicated to Titanic.</p>
    <p class="task-text">Your attention
        is invited to the first task that associated with analysis of some data. The goal
        of this course is to teach you how to use the d3.js library to build simple plots
        and diagrams. And also we hope that some data about Titanic's crash will be
        interesting for you.<p>
        <p class="task-text">During all the course you will use "titanic_data.csv" file that contains data about
        survivors and dead passengers of Titanic after the crash. For taking first task you
        should know that this file contains "survived" and "age" columns where "survived" fields
        contains "0" number (if passanger was dead) and "1" (if he was survived).</p>
        <p class="task-text">You task is to build plot the same as the plot on lower window on right. Result of your
        action you can see in top window. Plot that you should build represents dependences
        the number of survived people by age from the percentage of the total number of
        survivors.</p>
        <p class="task-text">For check you solution you can press the "check" button. After that you will see
        the result of check near with the button.
        That's all about task. Good luck!</p>

    <p class="little-title">Below is some information about d3.js and task that can be useful for you:<p>
